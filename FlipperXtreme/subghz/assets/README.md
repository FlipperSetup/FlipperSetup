#Sub-Ghz Frequencies in Xtreme

Officially supported frequencies: 300-350 MHz, 387-467.75 MHz, and 779-928 MHz (from [CC1101 chip docs](https://www.ti.com/product/CC1101))<br>
Unofficially supported frequencies: 281-361 MHz, 378-481 MHz, and 749-962 MHz (from [YARD Stick One/CC1111 Docs](https://greatscottgadgets.com/yardstickone/))

Currently no other Flipper firmware allows anything outside of the officially supported CC1101 specs without editing files that get overwritten with every update.
Xtreme has these options easily togglable in the Xtreme Settings app.

**NOTE: Operating outside supported frequencies can damage your amp and may not provide the same results as supported frequencies.<br>
Please understand what you're doing if you transmit on unsupported frequencies as medical devices are licensed to operate there.**
