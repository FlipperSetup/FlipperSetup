# BeamZ ShowBar with Laser
## [Thanks Phiko](https://github.com/phiko-misc)!

Add both .sub files and remote to the ShowBar with Lasers from BeamZ.<br>
The full name of the ShowBar is `Showbar 2X Par, 2X Butterfly and R/G Laser DMX IRC`<br>
The only difference between this showbar and the other showbars from BeamZ is that this has a laser and the others don't.
