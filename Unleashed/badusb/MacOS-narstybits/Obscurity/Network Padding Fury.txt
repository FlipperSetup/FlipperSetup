REM This script sets up a network padding technique.
REM Using Scapy to send padded IP packets with random payload length.
REM Each packet is padded with a random number of 'A' characters to obfuscate the payload.
REM This helps to add padding to the network traffic and increase the overall packet size.
REM Keep in mind that while network padding can add some level of privacy,
REM it doesn't guarantee complete anonymity or security.

REM By default, it sends 600 packets with random payload length and padding.
REM Current script runs for about 5 minutes 
REM Change the range value in the 'send([packet] * 600)' line 33
REM For example, changing it to 'send([packet] * 1200)' will last about 10 minutes.
REM Adjust the inter parameter to control the delay between each packet.
REM The current value is set to 0.5 seconds, but you can modify it as needed for your testing purposes.

REM Requirements: Python 3 and Scapy. You can install Scapy using the command 'pip3 install scapy'.
REM warnings can be ignored as they indicate that no IPv4 address is currently assigned to those interfaces. 
REM The script will continue to function as intended
