There was an original upload to @UberGuidoZ repo by @the0bone for a Theefun TFM01 fog machine. Thanks!<br>
<br>
I've found that this company makes most fog machines internal componants and sells to many manufacturers.<br>
Global Special Effects, Fog Masters, Chauvet, American DJ, Eliminator, Magmatic, are all the same remote.<br>
This receiver uses a standard C-13/C-14 connector like a PC power cord.<br>
<br>
I haven't found a fog machine with any other rf remote than this one. So have fun.<br>
