# Doorbell from ornotermes

PCB is labeled W727, uses 433.92MHz and 25 bits of data.<br>
Includes a spreadsheet to generate similar codes with different patterns.

The transmitter has a button in the back to change between 8 transmitted codes and the receiver plays a different sound depending on what code is sent. Found there was space for more codes so tried what looked like the rest of the codes. Found an alarm sound that the transmitter can't activate.

Included two UniRF files:
* [W727_A](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/blob/main/unirf/Doorbell_W727_A.txt)
* [W727_B](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/blob/main/unirf/Doorbell_W727_B.txt)
