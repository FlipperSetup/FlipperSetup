REM Launches terminal and spawns a forkbomb on every thread the system reports that then spawns shells that spawn forkbombs. It spawned about 850 processes in 15 seconds, there is no stopping it so be careful testing this thing is NASTY! It takes 5-10 sec to spin up the run pools so it's not immediate.
