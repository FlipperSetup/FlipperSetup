REM This script sets up a TCP randomization technique 
REM Using Scapy to randomize the TCP packets by introducing random delays 
REM between sending each packet. 
REM This helps to obfuscate the packet timing.
REM Also adds an element of randomness to the network traffic. 
REM Keep in mind that while it adds some level of randomness, 
REM it doesn't guarantee complete anonymity or security.


REM This runs 1000 randomized TCP packets which last about 5 minutes.
REM You can change the 'send_packet(packet) for _ in range(1000)' parameter to extend the time.
REM For example if you change to 2000 this will last about 10 minutes.
REM Adjust the values of min_delay and max_delay as per your requirement.

REM Requirements:Python 3, and Scapy can install using the command 'pip3 install scapy'
REM warnings can be ignored as they indicate that no IPv4 address is currently assigned to those interfaces. 
REM The script will continue to function as intended
