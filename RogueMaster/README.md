# Flipper Zero FW [ROGUEMASTER]
This firmware is a fork of [Unleashed/xMasterX](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware) and the main Flipper Devices FW! I will try to keep active development and updates from both in this build along with any other projects that can be found to be useful to the community. I try to keep this FW build the most cutting edge with updates from both and updates from active community projects.  

This software is for experimental purposes only and is not meant for any illegal activity/purposes. We do not condone illegal activity and strongly encourage keeping transmissions to legal/valid uses allowed by law.

## Install from Release
FLASH STOCK FIRST BEFORE UPDATING TO CUSTOM FIRMWARE!
- To avoid Application errors, delete /ext/apps before doing the RM firmware update
- To install new FW, extract the [latest release zip file](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins/releases) to a folder, put the folder in the update folder on your SD card, and run the update file inside the folder using the Archive app (down from flipper desktop). If you were previously unleashed, you need to update your extend_range.txt file.`UPDATE IGNORE FLAG TO TRUE TO UNLEASH YOUR FLIPPER!!` On any update, you may need to update this file and your unirf map file, so keep backups. ðŸ˜„

## Build

$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins.git
$ cd flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins/
