REM VNC is a technology that allows you to remotely control another computer. 
REM In this case, if the VNC server is started on a Mac, you can view 
REM and control that Mac from another computer using a VNC viewer application.



REM This script disables the firewall
REM disable the local address check for Screen Sharing
REM and enables screen sharing via sudo command (must know password Trying to find a workaround)


REM Now you can use your local computer to tap into the target
REM you can run the command open vnc://target_ip_address
REM replace "target_ip_address" with the actual I.p. of the remote MacOs

REM VNC Viewer should establish a connection to the target machine, 
REM you should be able to see and control the remote desktop of the target machine on your computer.

REM Note that the specific command and package name may vary 
REM based on the version of Homebrew and RealVNC available at the time of installation.
