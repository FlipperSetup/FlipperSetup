## United States

The use of a phone jammer, GPS blocker, or other signal jamming device designed to intentionally block, jam, or interfere with authorized radio communications is a violation of federal law.  There are no exemptions for use within a business, classroom, residence, or vehicle. Local law enforcement agencies do not have independent authority to use jamming equipment; in certain limited exceptions use by Federal law enforcement agencies is authorized in accordance with applicable statutes.

It is also unlawful to advertise, sell, distribute, import, or otherwise market jamming devices to consumers in the United States.

The use or marketing of a jammer in the United States may subject you to substantial monetary penalties, seizure of the unlawful equipment, and criminal sanctions including imprisonment.

It can be a matter of life and death: Private persons using radio-jamming devices to interfere with emergency responder communication. And it’s on the rise.

For many it’s just a prank, but interfering with public safety communication is against federal law. In fact it is illegal to buy, sell, or operate a jamming device – an offense that carries with it fines of up to $112,000 per act and time in federal prison.

## UK

The act of jamming is punishable by 2 years in prison.
